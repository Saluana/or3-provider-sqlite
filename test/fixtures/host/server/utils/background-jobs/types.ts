/**
 * @module server/utils/background-jobs/types
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Defines the background job contract for server-side streaming.
 * These types formalize the provider interface so multiple storage backends

 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Describe the job record and lifecycle state.
 * - Define provider capabilities and required methods.
 * - Centralize provider configuration defaults.
 *
 * Non-Goals:
 * - Implementing any storage or streaming logic.
 * - Defining API routes or authorization.
